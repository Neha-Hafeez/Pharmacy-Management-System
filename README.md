# Pharmacy Management System

The Pharmacy Management System is a mini project focused on medication order management and payment processing. This program includes login features and allows users to create, delete, and modify medicine orders, as well as check order details.

The program requires the user to provide the Batch_no, Quantity, Name, and Medicine when placing a new medication order. Users can also delete the most recent order by providing the order number. Additionally, the program includes a cosmetics corner feature that allows buyers to check product details such as quantity, batch no, trade/retail price, and expiry/manufacture date by scanning the product barcode or searching by name. The program generates a bill with all relevant details for the buyer.

The purpose of this program is to improve the accuracy, security, and efficiency of pharmaceutical store management. The system helps manage pharmacy resources easily and efficiently and keep track of all items in the store. It helps sellers keep track of expiration dates, prices, and remaining quantities of products, reducing the chances of mismanagement and saving time for both the customer and the seller.

The program also includes a stock management system that helps reduce the costs of holding stock to meet customer demand and ensures that there is enough material for production.
